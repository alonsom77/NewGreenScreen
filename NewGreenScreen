# Green Screen image with 3D
#for this project we take pictures with a green background and make them into 3D
#these pictures are then combined with another image to make a green screen effect
#when placed together all of these images create a 3D video. 

#3D image first
#Using the same picture, the program creates a red and cyan version of the image. 
# the pictures are then blended together to create an anaglyph that can be seen using 3D glasses.
